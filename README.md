# faceRecognition
face Recognition system using python and opencv.

This is a face recognition project using python and opencv.


There are 5 python files in this code.

-testcamp.py : This will check the proper working of your webcam.

-data.py : This file will collect the data(images) of the person. it will ask for the identity number of the person which will be 1,2,.. so on. It will capture 100 images of the person. you can increase or decrease that number(line 29)

-train.py : This python code will train the system. You just need to run this code.

-face detection.py : This will detect the face

-recognizer.py : In the line 16 you need to feed the name of the person in the array based on the ID number which you gave in data.py file.


Important notes to be taken:

-Make a folder named as dataset to store the data(images) which is captured in the data.py, this should be located in the same folder as the other python files are located.

-make sure that all the files which I have uploaded is there in the same project folder.
